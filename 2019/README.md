## [Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1)

First part was built for Python so it wasn't too difficult.

I tried to take a shortcut on the 2nd part by calculating on the fuel required for fuel and turns out that wasn't right. Did it the right way and got another answer, but the website said it wasn't right. Tried another person's solution, got the same answer as what I submitted. Tried submitting one more time, and it worked. ðŸ¤·

Hopefully I have better luck copying and pasting going forward...
