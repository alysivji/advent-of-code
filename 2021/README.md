# Advent of Code 2021

[AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

## Instructions

### Run

Look at `Makefile`

## Test

Need to figure out how to do it in TS

## Daily Impressions

### [Day 1: Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)

I spent some time after work
setting up a TypeScript development environment
so this wasn't as bad as doing things from scratch.
Learning TypeScript is not like Python
when it comes to element-wise array-maps.

Got the problem done, don't think it's the nicest solution,
but we are learning.
What more do I want?
