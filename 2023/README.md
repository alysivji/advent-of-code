## Daily Impressions

### [Day 1: Trebuchet?!](https://adventofcode.com/2013/day/1)

While the company I work for uses Dart / Flutter, it's not something I do on a regular basis as I'm a backend developer. I spent some time before this job practicing [Dart with Advent of Code](../2016/) and used that code to help me get this done.

I definitely hacked together a solution to get things out the door. Totally okay with it for now, its good to get re-familiar with types.

### [Day 2: Cube Conundrum](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)

This was more about reading the data into a data structure I could work with easily. Think I did a pretty good job as the second part flowed easily from my part 1.

### [Day 3: Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

Used an object-oriented approach to set up the problem and then used a functional style approach to solve each of the methods. There were some edges that I didn't think about, but after a while I realized I had to track clusters separately since the part numbers repeat.

Found a great article that showed me how to [overload operators in Dart](https://medium.com/pinch-nl/comparing-objects-in-dart-made-easy-with-equatable-d208e5eb9571).

### [Day 4: Scratchcards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

Today was easy. Feels like I'm going back to a lot of the OOP principles that I'm comfortable with in Dart. I should start looking at other people's solutions to make sure I'm doing things in a way that makes sense.
