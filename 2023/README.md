## Daily Impressions

### [Day 1: Trebuchet?!](https://adventofcode.com/2013/day/1)

While the company I work for uses Dart / Flutter, it's not something I do on a regular basis as I'm a backend developer. I spent some time before this job practicing [Dart with Advent of Code](../2016/) and used that code to help me get this done.

I definitely hacked together a solution to get things out the door. Totally okay with it for now, its good to get re-familiar with types.
