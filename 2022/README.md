## Daily Impressions

### [Day 1: Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

Fairly straight forward problem, but this was my first time writing a Go program so I struggled a ton.

TODO: look at solutions to figure out how to

### [Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)

[Good ole rock, nothing beats that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0SoKWLkmLU)

Today was a mess. Had to learn how to write Go code across multiple files.... which is a lot harder than it sounds.

Overall the logic was easy; still struggling with the lnguage

> If you work with Go programming, you quickly realize there are no concept sets. However, we can play some tricks with maps and structs to create a set.
>
> Unlike some programming languages, Go does not have any convenience functions to list out the keys or values of a map.

Today was a grind; would've been a few lines if I could do it in Python or TS. I did find [golang-set](https://github.com/deckarep/golang-set), but wanted to power through using the Go Standard Library which is apparently "batteries included". Not sure what batteries they are talking about; definitely not AA or AAA.

Aside: there is apparently a [Go port of lodash](https://github.com/samber/lo).
