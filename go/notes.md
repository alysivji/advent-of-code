# Go Notes

- declare variable with `var name T` or `name := [expression]`
- `make` is used to create arrays and mappings
  - `m = make(map[string]T)`
- append to add items to a slice
  - ???
- all exported functions start with a `Capital` letter, i.e. `math.Abs`

- Go has pointers, but they are not super userful for what we are doing

- struts for more complex objects
- no classes, but we can define methods on types
