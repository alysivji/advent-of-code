## Daily Impressions

### [Day 1: Historian Hysteria](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)

Today was easy. Since JavaScript doesn't have a `defaultdict`, it's messier than if I had used Python. :shrug: Need to see how other people solved it so I can start writing idiomatic TS.

### [Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)

Surprisingly hard puzzle... it's not really hard but I'm really rusty with my [JavaScript Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). [Array.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) and [Array.splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) FTW!

Pretty happy with my solution minus the for loop. Interested to see how people do this using pure functional paradigm.
