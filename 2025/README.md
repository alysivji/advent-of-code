## Installation Notes

Node.js has [TypeScript support](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html#full-typescript-support)! We can now use `tsx` vs `ts-node` to run scripts: `npx tsx file.ts`.

Downside is that `tsx` doesn't support type checking ([more info](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-nodejs/tsx-explained/)), but my IDE does so that should be good enough. Can always switch to stricter type checker later.
